##Read Me First

This code was created for an assignment in Getting and Cleaning Data.
The function is very simple, although often overly verbose for the sake of readability.
It begins by loading data in to 7 data frames, and then it assigns labels and merges them.
The code the subsets the larger frame, and takes the mean of the remaining columns by Participant and Activity
