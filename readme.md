##Read Me First

This code was created for an assignment in Getting and Cleaning Data.
The function is very simple, although often overly verbose for the sake of readability.
It begins by loading data in to 7 data frames, and then it assigns labels and merges them.
The code then subsets the larger frame, and takes the mean of the remaining columns by Participant and Activity.
Excess data is removed throughout to keep memory usage to a minimum.

The data set comes from Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012
Any use of the data set must include a reference to the original work noted in the above line.
